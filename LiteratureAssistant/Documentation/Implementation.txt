1) In order to create a directive that allowed back button functionality the following examples were used.

2) To implement a group add a new item with the name of the group.  Set the parentGroupItemId to the same
	items' itemId.  For the other items in the group set their groupItemId to the parentGroupItemId of the 
	parent item.  When accessing a group the business logic should retrieve all items with their groupItemIds
	set to the parents parentGroupItemId.

3) To implement a process add a new item with the name of the process.  Set the parentProcessItemId to the same
	items' itemId.  For the other items that are a part of that process set their processItemItd to the 
	parentProcessItemId of the parent process item.  If the parentGroupItemId is set on a parent process item,
	indicated by the parentProcessItemId is not null, then the group is subject to that process.  
	
	In the business logic a custom process can inherit from the Auto.IProcess interface.  This interface has an 
	OnProcessInitialLoad(IProcessItem processItem), OnProcessLoad(IProcessItem processItem), 
	OnProcessCompleted(IProcessItem processItem), 
	OnProcessInterval(double intervalMilliseconds, IProcessItem processItem).

	To get the display name of the item[number] items in the item class (i.e. item1, item13), use the following link:
